                <dd>
                    This is the least processed tea variety. Research shows, it may be the most effective tea in fighting various forms of cancer due to its
                    high antioxidants. White tea may also be good for teeth, since it contains high source of fluoride, catechins and tannins, that can strengthen
                    teeth, fight plaque and make it more resistant to acid & sugar.

                <dd>
                    Green tea is exceptionally high in flavonoids that can help boost your heart health by lowering bad cholesterol and reducing blood clotting.
                    Studies show this type of tea can also help lower blood pressure, triglycerides and total cholesterol.
                    green tea has a possible impact on liver, breast, prostate and colorectal cancers.

                <dd>
                    Unlike many other varieties, black tea is caffeinated, so it's important to monitor our intake. When we put a cup of black tea, we benefits ourselves
                    from flavonoids that combat inflammation and support healthy immune system.<br>
                    However we dont have to merely drink black tea tobenefit from its healthy properties. It can be steamed, cooled and then pressed on minor cuts, scrapes
                    and bruises to relief pain and reduce swelling. A black tea bath can also ease inflammation caused by skin rashes and conditions such as poison ivy.

                <dd>
                    Oolong tea is a traditional Chinese tea variety that’s made from the same plant used to make green and black teas.
                    Oolong tea is notable for containing l-theanine, an amino acid that reduces anxiety and increases alertness and attention.
                    Scientists have found that l-theanine can help prevent cognitive diseases such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases.
                    Oolong tea is also high in polyphenols, which are linked to lowering inflammation, preventing the growth of cancers and decreasing type 2 diabetes risk.
